# Data-Transmission-Using-LED-and-LDR-Over-a-Custom-Communication-Protocol
This project demonstrates a simple yet effective method of optical data transmission using an LED as the transmitter and an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) as the receiver, governed by a custom-built communication protocol.

To design a low-cost, short-range communication system using visible light and analog sensing, with manual framing and decoding logic.

## ⚙️ Features
- LED-based binary data transmission (ON/OFF pulses)
- LDR-based signal reception and analog-to-digital conversion
- Custom protocol: Start bit, data bits, stop bit
- Threshold calibration to reduce ambient noise
- Serial monitor output for verification

## 🧠 Technical Highlights
- Microcontroller: Arduino UNO
- Components: LED, LDR, Resistors, Breadboard
- Logic: Bit framing, timing control, analog thresholding
- Optional: Parity bit or checksum for error detection

## 🧪 Testing & Validation
- Manual bit pattern transmission
- Ambient light interference tests
- Protocol timing accuracy
- Serial output comparison with expected data


## 🚀 Applications
- Educational tool for protocol design and sensor interfacing
- Prototype for VLC (Visible Light Communication)
- Low-bandwidth signaling in embedded systems
